# Computing Competition 2021/22
The competition is open to year 10 and year 12 students in groups of 2-3 studying Computer Science.
You may choose to code in any programming language that is a higher level language. ***In other words not Scratch (or any other block language)!***

You must have your final submission code uploaded to the competition GitHub Classroom as shown by your teacher.
You must also submit a short video presentation showcasing your endeavour no longer than 2 mins maximum. You can do this using [MS Stream](https://web.microsoftstream.com/) with your office365 account. 
<sub>Videos here are private by default to our school and you can record your screen easily.</sub>

- Final submissions must be in by Fri 7th Jan
- Peer votes will be submitted no later than Fri 14th Jan
- Winners will be announced the following week.

## Your Challenge 
You are tasked with creating an app that takes an integer/decimal numberand returns the value as a string.
So for each input, the program should output a text result such as the table below: 

| INPUT | OUTPUT |
|-----------------------------------|---|
| `25` | `twenty-five` |                                               
| `102`  | `one-hundred-and-two` |                                               
| `7` | `seven` |
| `10.3` | `ten-point-three` |

Since last year's competition had a much harder challenge, I also want you to program the app so that it can output text based answers in a choice of 2 languages.

So the app should...

1. Allow the user to enter a number
2. enter a choice of language (eg. English, Yoruba, )
3. the program should then output the result as a string
4. Your program should include a GUI.


## Teacher Grading 60%

You will be graded on:

- Design of your program - How you will create the program (no more than 200 words)
    - 0 no-poor explenation
    - 1 partial explenation
    - 2 excellent detail
- efficiency of your code (variable names, functions etc)
    - 0 poor var names
    - 1 some naming is sensible
    - 2 all good!
- presentation of your program (gui / web interface)
    - 2 marks - Your program displays an output for a given integer
    - 2 marks - Correctly outputs the string for the given integer in at least the English language
    - 2 marks - Correctly outputs the string for the given integer in at least 2 languages
    - 2 marks - program allows for a change in output language based on user choice
- Your program has a nice design interface:
    - 0 no gui,
    - 2 ok GUI,
    - 5 excellent GUI
** There are a total of 17 possible marks here **

## Peer Grading 40%

Your peers will rank their favourite submissions in order. How much you recieve in points will be based on how many submissions there are.
***If*** there are **10 submissions** there are a total of **10 potential marks**. ***If there are 15 submissions, there are 15 potential marks***.

Participants will not be able to see who is part of each group. Only your teachers can see this and as such students will not know who the video presentation belongs to.

## Final grading

```python
teacher_grade = int(input("enter teacher grade"))
peer_grade = int(input("enter peer grade"))
final_grade = (teacher_grade * 0.6) + (peer_grade * 0.4)

```
