The first 12 weeks comes from firetech's TCP 2 course consisting of 1 hour per week for 12 weeks. Total time = 12 hours

The next 12 weeks are taken from the first 8 weeks of Harvard's CS50p course, requiring around 12 hours per week for 10 weeks.
Due to the great difference in time commitment between what is required of DofE and the CS50p course, I split the course into around 16 weeks, doing around 6 hours per 
week (including watching the lectures).

Here are my solutions.
